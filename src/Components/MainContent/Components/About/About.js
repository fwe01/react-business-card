			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				I love server-side development, but im stepping outside out of my comfort zone to learn about frontend stuff to be a Full Stack Developer.

				What i love the most from doing server-side development is being challenged to design a good system that are both easy to maintain and scale up.

				I'm also currently learning about game development, because i found it is fun to create your own game from scratch
